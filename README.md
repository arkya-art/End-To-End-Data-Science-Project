# End to End Data Analyst Project (Integrating Python, SQL & Tableau)

## Abstract
This project uses Absenteeism at work dataset for a courier company in Brazil with qualitative and Quantitative attributes. The input data is preprocessed and using Logistic regression model, the predictive analysis is done. The predicted outputs are stored within the MY-SQL database and designed a Dashboard in Tableau for qualitative analysis on inferenced outputs. The entire process is automated and stored as a python module.

## Dataset
The database was created with records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil. It contains attributes like identification ID, reason for absence ( stratified into 21 categories), Month of absence, Day of the week (Monday (2), Tuesday (3), Wednesday (4), Thursday (5), Friday (6)), Seasons (summer (1), autumn (2), winter (3), spring (4)), Transportation expense, Distance from Residence to Work (kilometers), Service time, Age, Work load Average/day,Hit target, Disciplinary failure (yes=1; no=0), Education (high school (1), graduate (2), postgraduate (3), master and doctor (4)), Son (number of children), Social drinker (yes=1; no=0), Social smoker (yes=1; no=0), Pet (number of pet), Weight, Height, Body mass index, Absenteeism time in hours (target)
